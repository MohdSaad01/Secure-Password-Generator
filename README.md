# Secure Password Generator

Welcome to the Secure Password Generator!  
This is a beginner-friendly Python project that allows users to generate strong, randomized passwords based on their preferences for:
- Number of letters (a-z, A-Z)
- Number of symbols (!, @, #, etc.)
- Number of digits (0-9)

The script asks for your inputs, combines all the characters, shuffles them to enhance security, and prints your final password.

## How It Works

1. Youâ€™ll be asked to enter:
   - How many letters you want
   - How many symbols you want
   - How many numbers you want

2. The program randomly selects characters from each group.

3. All characters are shuffled to ensure randomness.

4. It then displays your new, secure password.
